//  How do we assign a value to a variable?
    //  The assignment operator (=)

// How do we change the value of a variable?
    //  We can change the value of a variable with the different operators such as arithmetic (+, -, *, /)
//  How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
    //  The value of a variable can be assignment with the assignment operator (=)
// Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
    //  Variables can be declared with the var, let, and const keywords without a value
    //  Variables can be assigned with the assignment operator (=)
    //  Variables can be defined with the var, let, and const keywords with a value
//  What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
    //  Writing code in human readable form without a specific syntax.
    //  Pseudocode can be used to write detailed steps for creating an application with code.
    //  Pseudocode can also be presented to non-developers to explain how the app is made and will work.
//  What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
    //  50%
